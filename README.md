INTRODUCTION
---
This project focuses on analyzing sales performance across various product categories at Nova Retail Solutions (the leading provider of office supplies, furniture, and technology products) using advanced analytics tools in Excel. By exploring key metrics such as sales trends, revenue, and market opportunities, the analysis aims to provide valuable insights into product performance and business growth. Leveraging Excel’s powerful visualization and analytical capabilities, the project will uncover actionable data-driven strategies to optimize inventory, improve profitability, and enhance decision-making in a competitive market environment.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
---
Nova Retail Solutions faces several challenges in understanding the key drivers behind its sales and profitability. The company needs a clearer picture of regional sales performance, the effectiveness of different shipping modes, and which product categories contribute the most to profits. Without these insights, decision-makers struggle to make informed choices about resource allocation, pricing strategies, and customer service improvements. The lack of a centralized dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs) is hindering effective decision-making.

AIM OF THE PROJECT
---
Analysis On: 
* Sales Trend
* Profit and Sales across different Region
* Shipping performance
* Product profitability and Sales

SKILLS & CONCEPT DEMOSTRATED
---
* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding & Preparation
* Data import into Excel
* Create calculated fields and bulid visualizations
* Design the dashboard layout
* Interactive Slicers

MODELLING
---
I conducted comprehensive analysis by using pivot tables and slicers to get accurate analysis on the different KPIs. The data model consists of a main table, Orders, which includes fields such as (Order ID, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Segment, Postal Code, Product ID, Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit). Additionally, there are sub-tables for Customers, linking (customer names and IDs); Location, adding details like (postal code, city, state, region, and country) and Products, containing (product ID, category, subcategory, and product name). By integrating these tables, we can conduct comprehensive analyses to better understand sales performance at both the product and customer levels.

### Bar Chart
This bar chart compares sales, profits by region and profit by ship mode at Nova Retail across all years. It reveals that while a lot of sales were made, Nova Retail didn't make a lot of profit compared to sales and the most profitable ship mode is standard class. The gold bars represent sales, while the purple bars indicate profit.

### Line Chart 
This trend chart visualizes the profits trends across each year for each segment, along with the respective average profit values. It highlights periods where current profits exceed or fall below their respective averages. The 'triangle' shaped line facing upwards indicates a 'peak' period where profits are above the average, while the 'triangle' shaped line facing downwards represents a 'peak' period where they fall below average. This visualization provides a clear comparison of performance against the average, offering insights into fluctuations and helping identify periods of higher or lower profitability.

### Donut Chart 
This chart visualises the proportions of profit by product segment, with the size of each piece representing the proportion of each category.

DASHBOARD OVERVIEW
---
The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales & profit performance over a four-year period, from 2014 to 2017. It incorporates interactive slicers that allow users to filter and view performance data for a specific year, enabling focused analysis and comparison of sales & profit trends across different time frames.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
---
* Optimize pricing strategy by review pricing strategies for both high-performing and underperforming products, using the insights from yearly sales trends and average performance to set competitive prices that maximize profit without sacrificing volume.
* Offer product bundles combining high-margin and low-performing products to encourage customers to purchase more, thus improving sales performance across a broader range of products.
* Leverage cross-selling and upselling strategies by promoting complementary products in high-demand categories, increasing the overall transaction value per customer.

These recommendations aim to enhance sales performance by focusing on product optimization, pricing, and customer engagement strategies for the upcoming years.
